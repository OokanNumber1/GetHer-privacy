    * **Future Ratings (if implemented):** Information you may input in future features like "Rate Your Progress with Her," "Rate Her Reaction," and "Rate The Experience," and your self-assessment on handling rejection ("Rejection: How well am i taking this no?").

* **Advertising Identifiers:** We may collect advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA on iOS and Advertising ID on Android) which are unique, user-resettable IDs for advertising purposes. These identifiers help us and our advertising partners to deliver personalized ads and measure ad effectiveness.

**How We Use Your Information**

We may use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Improve the App:** To operate the App, provide its features, personalize your experience, and develop new features and improvements (such as the "Coming soon…" features).
* **To Analyze App Usage:** To understand how users interact with the App, identify trends, and optimize the App's performance and design.
* **To Personalize Content and Advertising:** To show you relevant content and advertisements within the App. This may involve using your ratings and usage data to understand your preferences.

* **To Communicate with You:** To respond to your inquiries and provide support.

**Sharing Your Information**

We may share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:

* **With Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating, providing, and improving the App (e.g., analytics providers, hosting providers). These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
* **For Advertising Purposes:** If we integrate advertising into the App, we may share advertising identifiers and aggregated, anonymized usage data with advertising partners to deliver targeted ads and measure ad effectiveness.
* **For Legal Compliance:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal process (e.g., a court order or subpoena).
* **To Protect Our Rights and Safety:** We may disclose your information when we believe it is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.
* **In Connection with a Business Transaction:** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice in the App of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.

**Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.
